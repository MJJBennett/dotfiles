-> Ensure exports properly exports everything
-> Rewrite install script to do everything individually
-> Add python tooling for more cumbersome install steps
-> 'dependency' tooling may be useful (ensure x is installed before y, etc)
-> exports isn't being copied (lol) figure out what's up and maybe make a dir
   so that everything is copied automatically, versioned automatically, backed
   up automatically, etc.
