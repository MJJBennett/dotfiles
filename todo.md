# Basic TODO List

- Ensure exports properly exports everything
- Rewrite install script to do everything individually (?)
- Add python tooling for more cumbersome install steps
  - 'dependency' tooling may be useful (ensure x is installed before y, etc) (need python for ^ etc)
- rg -i todo
- we can inject vim stuff through sourcing or symlinks, so we don't have to ./install.sh ever
- try out SmiteshP/nvim-navic?
- add config from lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim
- f alias for finding things..?

- rename all files to .filetype - no more local_exports etc.

- fresh install things we want
  - you need gcc for ripgrep
  - install rust please
  - there are way too many scripts!! consolidate/simplify.
  - need to install oh-my-zsh FIRST before installing the plugins
  - coc config: notification.statusLineProgress: false

# Permanent Notes

## Performance

https://blog.mattclemente.com/2020/06/26/oh-my-zsh-slow-to-load/#how-to-test-your-shell-load-time
- NVM information (idk what this means... maybe it's nvm that was making things slow?)
