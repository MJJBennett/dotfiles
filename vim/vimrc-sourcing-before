" Sometimes we are on a 'tiny' box where our vim is basically vi.
" In those cases, if we don't have eval, we can't really do anything.
" If we don't have eval, we actually can't even evaluate 'has' or if
" statements in general. Fortunately, vim-tiny does recognize that it
" would be ridiculously breaking to not do something for us here - so
" it skips the entire block entirely.
" If we have if statements but not eval, then we probably don't want
" to source extensions anyways. Regardless, this is all kind of silly
" and won't matter except in specific situations.
