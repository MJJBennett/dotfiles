# make it so you clone this to $DOTFILES_HOME
# then we don't have to install files

add config from lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim

f alias for finding things..?

rename all vim files to *.vim (for vim syntax)

- need to install oh-my-zsh FIRST before installing the plugins
- coc config: notification.statusLineProgress: false
